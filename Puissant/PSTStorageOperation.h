/**
 * An abstract class that encapsulates a request to the Database files.  This class is meant to
 * serve as a base class for requests, and is freely and highly subclass-able.  Subclasses must
 * override -mainRequest (not -main), and can optionally override -mainFinished.  Operations should
 * typically be sent a -startRequest message immediately after being created, but this is a general
 * guideline and is not enforced by the class.  Operations must be serialized for proper database 
 * resource access.
